      Hi Reader myself, Sushant the founder of this website I would love to share a little bit about me. <br> I was born and raised in Punjab, India. I Have completed high school in India. Besides being an average student in the class I also got the opportunity to represent India at the World Science fair in Russia. <br> I am also a chess player, I had 4 nationals back to back, and am also one of the top players in Winnipeg. In this life journey, I got the opportunity to work with a lot of great people where I had worked NASA(gravity), Samsung(Wireless-Charging). <br> I am always an explorer and travel Lover. Talking about family, I was raised by MOM but I also consider my 79 classmates as a part of my family where I had spent 7.5 years with them in the same Dorm room.

      MITT was a great escape route to find the inner me which was lost somewhere studying stuff I was never going to use in University! I did feel the reason why some of the world's greatest people hate university. I enjoy competitive coding as it gives me a kick to drive in and time flies by. I guess coding in general is a drug that keeps you high every second.

Talking about hobbies, I love pets and that craze is way too much that I'm ready to get a dog in a no-pets apartment. To date, I got a couple of beautiful fish. I love natural photography but it's only done by phone. You can have a look at my Insta @Sushantpb28.
I hate to organize things. I play Chess, Badminton. I did have a gym membership but only went once, with 0 dedication level!!!!!.
