      Hi Reader myself, Sushant the founder of this website I would love to share a little bit about me. <br> I was born and raised in Punjab, India. I Have completed high school in India.<br> Besides being an average student in the class I also got the opportunity to represent India <br> at the World Science fair in Russia. I am also a chess player, I had 4 <br> nationals back to back, and am also one of the top players in Winnipeg. <br>In this life journey, I got the opportunity to work with a lot of great people where <br> I had worked NASA(gravity), Samsung(Wireless-Charging).<br> I am always an explorer and travel Lover. Talking about family, I was raised by MOM but<br> I also consider my 79 classmates as a part of my family where <br>
